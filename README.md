Where is the stuff in UI or shortcut
 -->



<!-- ## TODO

Object list (UIlist)
- Object are created stored in a `GP` / `Gpencil` / `Drawings` collection (user can manually create sub-collection if needed)

Palette list (Material UIlist + buttons)
- Possibility to move materials

Brush association

## IDEAS

- set canvas grid color according to depth (or based on other information)
    - refreshed when changing object from dedicated UI list

- Set 1,2,3,4 buttons to brushes: Stroke, Fill, Negative Fill, Shadow
    - Need to create custom brushes (import from a blend or create from scratch)
    - Also need change to chosen layer (need to have association choice somewhere).
